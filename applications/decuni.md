# üìù PolkaID: Decentralized Student Identity Verification

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:** A global decentralized identity platform for university students, enabling trusted and private academic status verification across the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Brief Description:**
PolkaID is a decentralized identity (DID) protocol focused on authenticated student identity verification. It empowers students worldwide with cryptographic credentials that verify their university status, while allowing external institutions (e.g., employers, scholarship programs, web3 DApps) to access this data securely via a Polkadot-connected verification endpoint. With an initial database of over 10,000 universities, PolkaID lays the groundwork for decentralized academic credentials that integrate natively into the Polkadot ecosystem and beyond.

**Integration with Polkadot:**
PolkaID will leverage Polkadot parachains (e.g., KILT Protocol or Litentry) to anchor verifiable credentials. Identity proofs will be issued off-chain via Firebase and hashed on-chain using Polkadot, while verification services will expose a WASM-compatible API that allows DApps and validators to authenticate student identities through signed messages. We‚Äôll ensure compatibility with decentralized identity frameworks in the Polkadot ecosystem, particularly targeting integration with Identity pallets and DID registries.

**Team Interest:**
As a solo founder and builder deeply interested in educational equity and real-world use cases for blockchain identity, I (Ojewoye Wale Goddey) see PolkaID as a foundational tool for verifiable reputation. This project addresses an untapped area: university-level student verification in web3, opening the door for education-based DeFi access, talent pipelines, academic DAOs, and global scholarship distribution.

## üîç Project Details

**Technology Stack:**

* Flutter (Cross-platform frontend: Android, iOS, Web)
* Firebase (Realtime DB, Authentication, Hosting)
* Polkadot Parachain (for credential anchoring ‚Äî KILT, Litentry, or custom identity chain)
* REST/GraphQL endpoints for external verifiers
* Typesense for fuzzy student search indexing

**Core Components:**

1. **User-facing App (Flutter):**

   * Student registration with university selection (preloaded from 10,000+ universities)
   * Identity claim creation with verification (e.g., email/portal screenshots)
   * DID generation tied to student Firebase ID
   * Polkadot-compatible QR proof for third-party validation

2. **Verification API Layer:**

   * Endpoint where employers, DApps, or institutions can validate a student‚Äôs DID and credential
   * RESTful API with public key signature verification
   * Optional real-time Firebase webhook to fetch live verification status

3. **Blockchain Credential Anchoring:**

   * Use of Polkadot parachain identity modules to anchor hashed metadata
   * Each claim issued will be timestamped and stored on-chain
   * Flexible revocation system integrated via Firebase flags and on-chain hashes

4. **Admin Console:**

   * Web interface for moderators to approve claims from students before they go on-chain
   * Statistics dashboard (number of verified students, institutions, use cases)

## üìä Development Status

The following are already available or in progress:

* Database of 10,000+ universities across all regions (CSV parsed and indexed)
* Firebase backend (Authentication + Firestore structure)
* Flutter frontend (WIP, targeting MVP within 2‚Äì3 weeks)

This grant will fund the full decentralized identity integration with Polkadot and the student verification gateway/API.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

### **Ecosystem Position:**

PolkaID fills a key gap in the Polkadot identity space by creating a scalable, education-specific DID verification layer. While protocols like KILT and Litentry support identity primitives, PolkaID will specialize in academic credentialing and act as a gateway for onboarding university students into the Polkadot ecosystem via reputational credentials.

### **Target Users:**

* **Students:** Verified DID holders who can participate in DApps and DAOs using their academic status
* **Verifiers:** Employers, DeFi protocols, or community DAOs that want student credential proofs
* **Builders:** DApps needing a secure way to filter users by academic reputation or affiliation

### **Problems Solved:**

* Prevents fraudulent claims of academic status in web3 grants, jobs, scholarships
* Offers a reusable student identity for access to education-based DAOs or discounts
* Builds a new bridge between university systems and decentralized platforms

### **Similar Projects:**

* [KILT Protocol](https://www.kilt.io/) ‚Äì general-purpose credentials
* [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) ‚Äì social trust-based identity
* PolkaID is distinct by focusing narrowly on academic verification with a Firebase/Flutter stack for mass adoption.

## üîÆ Future Plans

### **Short-Term (Next 3‚Äì6 Months):**

* Add verification integrations with top Polkadot DApps (DAO tools, scholarship funds)
* Deploy automated university email verification
* Launch validator node that accepts credential hash submissions

### **Long-Term Vision (6‚Äì12 Months):**

* Introduce NFT-based academic certificates
* Enable cross-chain student identities (e.g., XCM + DID compatibility)
* Collaborate with parachains on reputation systems for hackathons, fellowships, and DAOs

## üì¢ Final Thoughts

PolkaID proposes a high-impact application of decentralized identity: verifiable academic status. It not only solves a real-world problem but brings a new, educated demographic into the Polkadot ecosystem. With existing resources (university data, Firebase setup, Flutter experience), this is a low-risk, high-value proposal with clear outcomes and a path to long-term sustainability.
